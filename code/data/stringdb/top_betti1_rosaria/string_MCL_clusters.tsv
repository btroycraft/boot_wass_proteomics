MCL	1	Red	3	G3PKP7	69293.ENSGACP00000018177	NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 9
MCL	1	Red	3	G3Q486	69293.ENSGACP00000024690	ATP synthase subunit d, mitochondrial; Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the cent [...]
