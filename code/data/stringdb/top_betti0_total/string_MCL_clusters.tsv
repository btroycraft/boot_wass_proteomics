MCL	1	Red	5	G3N8X9	69293.ENSGACP00000001765	Uncharacterized protein; Actin, beta-like 2; Belongs to the actin family
MCL	1	Red	5	G3PJV6	69293.ENSGACP00000017886	Heat shock protein 90kDa alpha (cytosolic), class B member 1
MCL	1	Red	5	G3PLE8	69293.ENSGACP00000018429	ATP synthase subunit beta; Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane
MCL	1	Red	5	G3Q0N5	69293.ENSGACP00000023430	Solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; adenine nucleotide translocator), member 4; Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier (TC 2.A.29) family
MCL	2	Yellow	4	G3NG11	69293.ENSGACP00000004266	Ribosomal protein L24
MCL	2	Yellow	4	G3NXT2	69293.ENSGACP00000010152	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C; Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation
