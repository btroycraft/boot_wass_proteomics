MCL	1	Red	6	G3PKP7	69293.ENSGACP00000018177	NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 9
MCL	1	Red	6	G3PM61	69293.ENSGACP00000018692	Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit Rieske, mitochondrial; Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential coupled to ATP synthesis
MCL	1	Red	6	G3PQL2	69293.ENSGACP00000019897	ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, mitochondrial; Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain
MCL	2	Yellow	3	G3NRK0	69293.ENSGACP00000007967	40S ribosomal protein SA; Required for the assembly and/or stability of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Required for the processing of the 20S rRNA- precursor to mature 18S rRNA in a late step of the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Also functions as a cell surface receptor for laminin. Plays a role in cell adhesion to the basement membrane and in the consequent activation of signaling transduction pathways. May play a role in cell fate determination and tissue morphogenesis; Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uS2 family
