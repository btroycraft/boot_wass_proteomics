MCL	1	Red	5	G3NRK0	69293.ENSGACP00000007967	40S ribosomal protein SA; Required for the assembly and/or stability of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Required for the processing of the 20S rRNA- precursor to mature 18S rRNA in a late step of the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Also functions as a cell surface receptor for laminin. Plays a role in cell adhesion to the basement membrane and in the consequent activation of signaling transduction pathways. May play a role in cell fate determination and tissue morphogenesis; Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uS2 family
MCL	1	Red	5	G3NXT2	69293.ENSGACP00000010152	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C; Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation
MCL	1	Red	5	G3PP78	69293.ENSGACP00000019411	Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2; Molecular chaperone; assists the folding of proteins upon ATP hydrolysis
MCL	1	Red	5	G3PQX4	69293.ENSGACP00000020009	Ribosomal protein L31
MCL	1	Red	5	G3Q4Z0	69293.ENSGACP00000024944	Tubulin beta chain; Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha chain
MCL	2	Yellow	3	G3NJU3	69293.ENSGACP00000005605	Myosin, light chain 12, genome duplicate 1
MCL	2	Yellow	3	G3NS10	69293.ENSGACP00000008127	Actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1a; Belongs to the actin family
MCL	2	Yellow	3	G3Q3X8	69293.ENSGACP00000024582	Talin 1
MCL	3	Green	2	G3NDE4	69293.ENSGACP00000003344	Expressed sequence CO360592; NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex, 4, 15kDa
MCL	3	Green	2	G3PQL2	69293.ENSGACP00000019897	ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, mitochondrial; Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain
MCL	4	Blue	2	G3PYU1	69293.ENSGACP00000022781	Cathepsin D; Belongs to the peptidase A1 family
MCL	4	Blue	2	G3Q393	69293.ENSGACP00000024345	Spectrin alpha 2
